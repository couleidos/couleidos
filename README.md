# Git-n-Go: A playful place to take on a BIG project with limited knowledge!  

👋 Hi, I’m @couleidos! I initially created this repo to learn the basics. Now I need a space to practice editing, adding, merging, cloning, or whatever the hell this involves with a few people on my awesome team!
- 👀 I love all things history (the dark crazy stuff), cemetery preservation, literature (pretty much ALL genres) b/c the oral and written word is like oxygen! it brings me life! I find JOY and REJUVENATION when hiking amongst trees and I breathe in the energies of the Tar and Roanoke Rivers, Upper Fishing Creak, and ANY OCEAN I can get to!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about AI! I'm fascinated with the intersection of culture and technology. AND - cybersecurity! The world could actually go bananas if the right CRAZY, foolish, and selfish hacker brought down all systems. Like WHYYY are we subject to that mess? 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the above items of interest and learning opportunities. My degrees are in Africana Studies and English and I am a bootleg techie, soI'm happy to collaborate and share my expertise in those areas.
- 📫 How to reach me: coulee.eidos@gmail.com or if you are a friend of a friend, you can find me on facebook - maybe! 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her/Them - HUMAN!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I appear as an extrovert. BUT I AM an introvert. I learned over the years to come out of my shell. I'm still not sure if that is a good or bad thing.
